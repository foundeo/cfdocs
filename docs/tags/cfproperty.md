# cfproperty

Defines properties of a CFML component (CFC). Used to
 create complex data types for web services. The attributes of
 this tag are exposed as component metadata and are subject to
 inheritance rules.

## Attribute Reference

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| name | string | Yes |  | Specifies the name of the property. |
| type | string | No |  | Specifies the ColdFusion data type for the property. |
| required | boolean | No |  | Whether the parameter is required |
| default | string | No |  | This sets the default value on the property when the object is created. For ORM Entities, this only works for static values. Variable values like the current timestamp can be set by a function "preInsert" in the component. |
| displayname | string | No |  | A value to be displayed when using introspection to show<br /> information about the CFC. The value appears in parentheses<br /> following the property name. |
| hint | string | No |  | Text to be displayed when using introspection to show<br /> information about the CFC. This attribute can be useful<br /> for describing the purpose of the parameter. |
| fieldtype | string | No |  | This attribute is used to specify the type of the property. Use this attribute to specify the following:<br />* Primary key: Specify fieldtype = "id" to map a property to the primary key in the table. <br />* Column: Specify the fieldtype = "column" to map a property to a column in the table.<br />* Relationship: Specify the fieldtype = "relationship_type". The relationship_type can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, or many-to-many.<br />* Version: Specify the fieldtype="version‚Äù to indicate that the column contains versioned data.<br />* Timestamp: Specify the fieldtype="timestamp" to indicate the column contains data with timestamp.<br />* Collection: Specify the fieldtype="collection" to define the collection mapping. |
| ormType | string | No |  | Used to specify the data type of the primary key. If data type is not set and the ORM setting<br />useDBForMapping=true, then the ormtype is determined by inspecting the database. |
| column | string | No |  | Used to specify the primary key column name. |
| generator | string | No |  | Algorithm used to generate unique identifiers for instances of the persistent CFC. |
| sequence | string | No |  | Sequence key name in the database. |
| selectkey | string | No |  | The column name that is used to retrieve the primary key generated by a database trigger. |
| params | string | No |  | Additional parameters required by the various generators to generate the ID.<br />The value for the params attribute should follow the CF Struct syntax. For example: params = {key1='value1', key2='value2'} |
| length | string | No |  | Use this attribute to specify the length of the column. This attribute is used for table creation only. |
| precision | string | No |  | Specifies the precision value. |
| index | string | No |  | Specifies the name of an index that is created using the mapped column |
| setter | boolean | No |  | Specifies whether to generate setter methods or not |
| getter | boolean | No |  | Specifies whether to generate getter methods or not |
| source | string | No | vm | Specifies the source from where the timestamp has to be retrieved |
| elementcolumn | string | No |  | Column name in the table that is used as value in struct. |
| elementtype | string | No |  | Data type of the value. |
| structkeytype | string | No |  | Specifies the data type of the key, when collectiontype=struct. |
| structkeycolumn | string | No |  | The column in the target table to use as key if the collection type is struct. |
| inversejoincolumn | string | No |  | Specifies the foreign key column in the Join table that references the primary key column in the target table. |
| linkschema | string | No |  | Schema for the link table |
| linkcatalog | string | No |  | Catalog for the link table |
| linktable | string | No |  | Name of the link table |
| missingRowIgnored | boolean | No |  | If the value is true, and the row that is referenced by the foreign key is missing, it is treated as a null<br />association. The default is false, in which case an exception occurs. |
| inverse | boolean | No |  | A Boolean value that specifies bidirectional association |
| orderby | string | No |  | Specifies the Order By string. |
| fkcolumn | string | No |  | Specifies the foreign key column |
| fetch | string | No |  | Specifies if it is outer-join fetching or sequential select fetching |
| cascade | string | No |  | Specifies which operations should be cascaded from the parent object to the associated object |
| constrained | boolean | No |  | Whether a constraint is set on this table's Primary Key column to reference the Primary Key in the other table |
| unique | boolean | No |  | Specifies if there should be a unique constraint on the column. |
| uniquekey | string | No |  | Groups columns in a single unique key constraint. |
| notnull | boolean | No |  | A Boolean value that specifies whether a notnull constraint should be added for this column. |
| update | string | No |  | Whether the column should be included in the SQL update statement.<br />Set update=false and insert=false if the column needs to be read-only. |
| insert | boolean | No |  | Whether the column should be included in SQL UPDATE and/or INSERT statements.<br />Set update=false and insert=false if the column needs to be read-only. |
| generated | string | No |  | Specifies that this property value is actually generated by the database {never|always|insert}<br />* never: Specifies that the value for this property is never generated by database<br />* always: Specifies that the value for this property is always generated by database<br />* insert: Specifies that the value for this property is generated at the time of insert but is not regenerated at updates. |
| formula | string | No |  | SQL expression that defines the value of the property. If you specify a formula, the column value is ignored. |
| lazy | string | No |  | Specifies if loading is to be done by parts: |
| optimisticLock | boolean | No |  | Whether updates to this property require acquisition of the optimistic lock on the table row |
| scale | string | No |  | Specifies the scale value |
| mappedby | string | No |  | Property in the target CFC that is referenced by the foreign key in the Join table. |
| cfc | string | No |  | Name of referenced CFC |
| joinColumn | string | No |  | Use this attribute to define the join column for inheritance mapping. |
| validate | string | No |  | Takes the validator to be used for validating data when implicit setter for this property is called. |
| validateParams | string | No |  | Takes the parameters required by the validator specified in the validate attribute. <br /> This should be specified in the implicit struct notation eg. validateparams="{min=18,max=60}">.<br /><br />min: Minimum value if validate is integer/numeric/<br />max: Maximum value if the validate is integer/numeric/<br />minLength: Minimum length of the string if the validate is string<br />maxLength: Maximum length of the string if the validate is string<br />pattern: regex expression if the validator specified in validate attribute is regex |
| cacheUse | string | No |  | Type of cache to use |
| sqlType | string | No |  | Use this attribute to specify the DB-specific SQLType that should be used for the column. This attribute is used for table creation only.<br />If this attribute is not specified, ColdFusion will automatically decide the SQLType based on the ormtype specified for this property. |
| dbDefault | string | No |  | This sets the default value of a column in the table when schema is exported. |
| where | string | No |  | Where condition |
| persistent | boolean | No |  | Specifies whether this property should be persisted. If<br />persistent="false‚ all the ORM related attributes are ignored.<br />Set this attribute to false if you do not want this property to be persisted by ORM. |
| unSavedValue | string | No |  | An identifier property value that indicates that an instance is newly instantiated and not saved/loaded in the database |
| serializable | boolean | No |  | Specifies whether this property can be serialized. If you set this value to<br />false, the property cannot be serialized, so any changes made are not retained on session replication, and the property has its default value (if any) on the second server. <br />Use this attribute to prevent serialization of properties in CFCs that are serializable. |
| singularname | string | No |  | Use this property to define the custom name for generated relationship methods. Applies to one-to-many and many-to-many |
| remotingFetch | boolean | No |  | If remotingFetch is false, then the value of that attribute is not sent over flash remoting. remotingFetch is true by default was all properties. But in case of cfcs for which persistent = true, the value of the remotingFetch attribute is false by default for any property that shares one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one or many-to-many relationship. |
| table | string | No |  | Table name |
