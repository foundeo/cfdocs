## Attribute Reference

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | string | No |  | The MIME content type of the page, optionally followed by<br /> a semicolon and the character encoding. By default,<br /> CFML sends pages as text/html content type in<br /> the UTF-8 character encoding. |
| deletefile | boolean | No | NO | Applies only if you specify a file with the file attribute.<br /> <br /> Yes: deletes the file on the server after sending its<br /> contents to the client.<br /> No: leaves the file on the server. |
| file | string | No |  | Name of file whose contents will be the page output. When<br /> using CFML in a distributed configuration, the file<br /> attribute must refer to a path on the system on which the<br /> web server runs. When you use this attribute, any other<br /> output on the current CFML page is ignored; only the<br /> contents of the file is sent to the client. |
| variable | string | No |  | Name of a ColdFusion MX binary variable whose contents can<br /> be displayed by the browser, such as the contents of a chart<br /> generated by the cfchart tag or a PDF or Excel file<br /> retrieved by a cffile action="readBinary" tag.<br /> When you use this attribute, any other output on the current<br /> CFML page is ignored; only the contents of the file are sent<br /> to the client. |
| reset | boolean | No | YES | The reset and file attributes are mutually exclusive.<br /> If you specify a file, this attribute has no effect.<br /><br /> Yes: discards output that precedes call to cfcontent<br /> No: preserves output that precedes call to cfcontent. In<br /> this case all output is sent with the specified type. |
