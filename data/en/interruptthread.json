The behavior depends on the thread's current state:\r\n- If the thread is blocked in a ThreadJoin or sleep method call: its interrupt status will be cleared and it will \r\nreceive an InterruptedException\r\n- If the thread is executing a long-running operation with interrupt checks: the operation may terminate early\r\n- If the thread is not alive: the interrupt request may have no effect",
