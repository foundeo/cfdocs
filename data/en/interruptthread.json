The behavior depends on the thread's current state:\n- If the thread is blocked in a ThreadJoin or sleep method call: its interrupt status will be cleared and it will \nreceive an InterruptedException\n- If the thread is executing a long-running operation with interrupt checks: the operation may terminate early\n- If the thread is not alive: the interrupt request may have no effect",
