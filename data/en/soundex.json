	"description": "Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as pronounced in English.\nThe goal is for homophones to be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite minor differences in spelling.\nThe algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter.\n\nSoundex is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms, as it is a standard feature of MS SQL and Oracle, and is often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for 'phonetic algorithm'",
