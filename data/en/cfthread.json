	"description":"The cfthread tag enables multithreaded programming in ColdFusion.\n Threads are independent streams of execution, and multiple threads\n on a page can execute simultaneously and asynchronously, letting you\n perform asynchronous processing in CFML. CFML code within the cfthread\n tag body executes on a separate thread while the page request thread\n continues processing without waiting for the cfthread body to finish.\n You use this tag to run or end a thread, temporarily stop thread execution,\n or join together multiple threads.",

If you dont specify a timeout and thread you are joining\n to doesnt finish, the current thread also cannot finish processing.\n run Creates a thread and starts it processing.\n sleep Suspends the current threads processing for the time specified\n by the duration attribute. This action is useful if one thread must wait\n for another thread to do processing without joining the threads.\n terminate Stops processing of the thread specified in the name attribute.\n If you terminate a thread, the thread scope includes an ERROR metadata\n structure with information about the termination.
