Trace\n requests cannot have bodies. This method enables the\n CFML application to see what is being received\n at the server, and use that data for testing or\n diagnostic information.\n * OPTIONS A request for information about the\n communication options available for the server or the\n specified URL. This method enables the CFML\n application to determine the options and requirements\n associated with a URL, or the capabilities of a server,\n without requesting any additional activity by the\n server.","required":false,"default":"get","type":"String","values":["get","post","put","delete","head","trace","options"]},
