_jre_:

Java runtime files.

_uninstall_:

Files to uninstall ColdFusion.

 

Note: The ColdFusion_install\cfusion\bin directory contains the Jvm.config file.

 

<strong>Using the built-in web server</strong>

ColdFusion provides in-built Tomcat application server that you can use to develop ColdFusion applications.

Note that the version of Tomcat application server bundled with ColdFusion 11 is 7.0.52.


During the ColdFusion installation, choose a web server. If you select the built-in web server, your web root directory is located in the cfroot/wwwroot directory. By default, the web server runs on port 8500. It means that to display a page in your application, append:8500 to the host name or IP address in the URL; for example, http://localhost:8500/YourApp1/index.cfm. If the page does not appear, ensure that the document is located in the built-in web server's web root directory; for example, C:\ColdFusion11\cfusion\wwwroot\YourApp1\index.cfm.

Note: If port 8500 is in use, the installer checks up to 100 ports (starting with 8501) to find a port that is not used. ColdFusion uses that port and displays a message to indicate the selected port.

If you select an external web server during installation, the built-in web server is deactivated.

<strong>Change the port of the built-in web server</strong>
1. Back up the server.xml file. This file is in the cfroot\cfusion\runtime\conf directory.
2. Open the original server.xml file for editing.
3. Search for internal webserver start.Update the port number.

    <Connector executor="tomcatThreadPool" maxThreads="50"
    port="8500" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol"
    connectionTimeout="20000"
    redirectPort="8445" compression="on" useSendfile="no" compressableMimeType="text/html,text/xml"/>

4. Save the file and then restart ColdFusion.
 

<strong>Configuring the built-in web server (Tomcat)</strong>

While installing, if you have configured ColdFusion on an external web server, do the following to configure ColdFusion on in-built Tomcat:

1. Open the cfroot\cfusion\runtime\conf\server.xml file.
2. Search for internal webserver start.Uncomment the following connector XML.

    <Connector executor="tomcatThreadPool"
    port="8500" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11Protocol"
    connectionTimeout="20000"
    redirectPort="8445"/>

Save the file, and then restart ColdFusion.

To enable OS Symbolic links after switching to Tomcat, edit the context.xml file found in /cfusion/runtime/conf/ to add allowLinking="true" attribute to the context element.

 

<strong>Starting, stopping, and restarting ColdFusion</strong>

<strong>On Windows</strong>
1. At prompt, go to the directory cfroot\cfusion\bin and run the following command: coldfusion.exe -start -console. To stop ColdFusion, use the command coldfusion.exe -stop -console. To restart, use the command coldfusion.exe -restart -console.Alternatively, you could also start, stop, and restart ColdFusion server using Windows Services.

Note: Paused tasks misfire when restarting ColdFusion.

 

Note: As possible in previous versions of ColdFusion, you can also use the cfstart script to start/stop the ColdFusion sever.

 

Note: The -console argument is optional. If it is not provided, the logs are saved in the cfroot\cfusion\logs directory.

_On UNIX/Linux/Solaris/MAC OSX_

1. At prompt, go to the directory cfroot\cfusion\bin and run the following command: ./coldfusion start}}To stop ColdFusion, use the command ./{{coldfusion stop. }}To restart, use the command {{./coldfusion restart.

Note: Paused tasks misfire when restarting ColdFusion.

 

Note: Use the status command to find the status of ColdFusion server.

 

<strong>Editing the JVM settings</strong>

To edit the JVM settings, open the cfroot\cfusion\bin\jvm.config file and update the following details:

* java.home: Java home. If not set, ColdFusion verifies the default JRE in the cfroot\jre folder, in the registry, or in the J{{AVA_HOME}} environment variable.
* java.args: Settings for -Xmx, ColdFusion classpath, and so on.
* java.library.path: Settings for library path.
* java.class.path: Additional classpath settings in a comma-separated list.
* application.home: Default is cfroot\cfusion
 


<strong>Creating and editing a new ColdFusion instance</strong>

After installing ColdFusion in stand-alone mode, create an instance of ColdFusion using the ColdFusion Administrator.

1. In the ColdFusion Administrator, go to Enterprise Manager > Instance Manager.
2. Click Add New Instance.
3. Enter the server name and server directory.
4. (Optional) Check Create Windows Service.
5. Click Submit. In the Instance Manager, start, stop, restart, delete, access website, or access administrator.
6. Click the Edit icon to edit the instance manager.
7. Edit the internal webserver port and load balancing factor.Load balancing factor represents the load the instance takes up. Load balancing factor is applicable only if the instance is part of the cluster. For example, the load balancing factor for the first instance is 1 and that of the second instance is 2. The second instance receives two times more requests.
8. Click Submit.
 

<strong>Registering a remote instance</strong>

Register a new remote instance of ColdFusion using the ColdFusion Administrator.

1. In the ColdFusion Administrator, click Enterprise Manager > Instance Manager > Register Remote Instance.
2. Specify the details such as instance name, remote host, remote port, http port, and JVM route. Instance name is a string that is used to identify the instance. Remote port and HTTP port are displayed in the Instance Manager page. These ports are provided in the server.xml file available in the runtime\conf folder of the instance. Remote port is the AJP port and the instance port is the connector port.JVM route is the remote instance name. The JVM route is an attribute that acts as an identifier for a particular Tomcat worker. JVM route is provided in the server.xml file available in the runtime\conf folder of the instance. For more information on JVM route, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/cluster-howto.html.

Note: A remote instance and a local instance cannot have the same JVM route if they are added in a cluster with sticky session enabled.

<strong>Configuring Secured Socket Layer (SSL)</strong>

SSL allows the browser and the server to communicate over a secured connection. Data that is sent is encrypted at one side, transmitted, and then decrypted at the other end. For more information about SSL configuration on Tomcat, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/ssl-howto.html.
To configure SSL for ColdFusion using the keytool utility, do the following:

1. Create a certificate file:
    a. Run the following command:cfroot\jre\bin\keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA
    b. Type the details as per the instruction.

If you do not provide a password, the default password for keystore and key is changeit. If you don't want to use the default password, ensure that you provide the same password for the keystore and the key.

Running this command creates a certificate.keystore in the following location:

* Windows: C:\Documents and Settings_user's_director_y
* Linux: usr/home

2. Open the cfroot\cfusion\runtime\conf\server.xml file and search for the string Define a SSL HTTP/1.1.
3. Uncomment the connector details and update the section as follows:

    <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
    SSLEnabled="true" maxThreads="150" scheme="https"
    secure="true" keystoreFile="<certificate_location>\.keystore" keystorePass="<password>" keyAlias="tomcat"   clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />


4. Restart ColdFusion.
5. Access ColdFusion using the following URL: https://<ip-address>:8443/CFIDE/administrator
 


<strong>Changing virtual directory and the doc root</strong>

Do the following to change the virtual directory and doc root:

1. Open CFInstallation\cfusion\runtime\conf\server.xml.
2. Under host block, search for the string, "To add virtual directory."
3. Uncomment the entry context path below.
4. To add a virtual directory, add the aliases attribute as shown below:

    <Context path="/" docBase="<absolute_path_to_cfrootectory>\wwwroot" WorkDir="       <cf_home>\runtime\conf\Catalina\localhost\tmp" aliases="/path1=<absolute_path_to_directory1>,/path2=        <absolute_path_to_directory2>"></Context>

Note: Alias path must include a leading /.

5. To change the doc root, change the docBase value in the above entry.For more details on the Context attributes, see http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/context.html.

<strong>Changing the connector port for cfstat</strong>

You can use the connector output for logging cfstat metric. The cfconnector port is defined in the CFInstallation/cfusion/lib/neo-metric.xml file. If you have configured a connector, update the port with the connector port. The connector port (AJP port) is provided in the CFInstallation/cfusion/runtime/conf/server.xml.
To update the connector port using the Administrator console:

1. Login ColdFusion Administrator.
2. Click Debugging & Logging > Debug Output.
3. Update the connector port and click Submit Changes.

<strong>Enabling Search Engine Safe URLs</strong>

Search Engine Safe URL (SES) helps the search engines to index dynamic web pages. SES URLs pass parameters using slashes instead of default URL pattern. By default, SES is enabled for stand-alone installation of ColdFusion on Tomcat.

Note: SES is applicable only for stand-alone installation of Tomcat. It does not work if ColdFusion is deployed as a WAR file on Tomcat.

 

Note: If you wish to use custom SES URLs, also add the URL entry to the uriworkermap.properties file found in the wsconfig folder for your web server.

 

<strong>Enabling Secure Profile</strong>

ColdFusion allows you to secure ColdFusion server furthermore by enabling or disabling certain settings. When installing ColdFusion, you can enable Secure Profile by selecting the option when prompted on the Secure Profile screen. Further, you could provide a comma separate list of IP addresses that may be allowed to access the ColdFusion Administrator. In ColdFusion 11, IP address restriction is supported at the connector-level. For more information, see this document.

 

<strong>Changing the log rotation settings</strong>

You can change the log rotation settings such as maximum number of backup files and the size of the backup files.

1. Specify log file settings in the neo-logging.xml, located in the <ColdFusion_Home>\lib directory.
2. The size of coldfusion-out.log and coldfusion-error.log is set to 20MB by default. You can change the size of the log in the neo-logging.xml file by changing the maxOutLogSize setting.
3. You can also change the maximum number of backups of coldfusion-out.log and coldfusion-error.log that ColdFusion takes during log rotation within the neo-logging.xml file. Change the maxOutFileBackup setting.
You can change the settings of the remaining files in the ColdFusion Administrator by going to the Debugging and Logging > Logging Settings section. Change the Maximum file size and Maximum number of Archives settings accordingly.

 

<strong>Enabling persistent session</strong>

To persist a session after a Tomcat restart, do the following:

1. Open the cfroot\cfusion\runtime\conf\context.xml file.
Uncomment the Manager pathname node.

Note: Flex sessions are not persisted after a Tomcat restart.

 

<strong>Updating from an earlier version</strong>

If you have skipped the migration or you have to make modifications to the previous installation that has to be migrated, do the following:

1. Stop the server.
2. Save settings by copying the files cf_webapp_root/WEB-INF/cfusion/lib/neo-*.xml (of previous installation) to a directory named cf_X_settings (in which X is the earlier version of ColdFusion) in the cf_webapp_new_installation_root_directory/WEB-INF/cfusion/lib directory.
3. Edit the ColdFusion 11 cfusion/lib/adminconfig.xml file by setting the value of the runmigrationwizard and the {{migratecf}}X (in which X is the earlier version of ColdFusion) switch to true.
4. Restart the ColdFusion 11 application.
5. Browse to ColdFusion Administrator to run the migration wizard.
