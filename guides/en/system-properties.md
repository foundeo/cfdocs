# ColdFusion Java System Properties

There are several ColdFusion Java System properties that have been created for various reasons. Usually they exist to work around
bugs that were fixed but then cause a backwards compatibility change.

## `-Dcoldfusion.udf.reuseTagInstances`

This setting was added in CF2016+ to address issues:

* Premature termination of the loop when invoking a UDF recursively while using CFLOOP to loop over a query that is defined as a var function local variable
* Incorrect struct modification issue when the CFHTTP tag is using a struct that has been passed to it via the CFTHREAD tag

The ColdFusion 2016 [release notes](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/release-note/coldfusion-2016-release-notes.html) instruct you to set `-Dcoldfusion.udf.reuseTagInstances=false` if you see those issues.

## `-Dhttps.protocols`

Set this to restrict the SSL and or TLS protocols that will be used by tags such as CFHTTP. The possible values are: SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2 and can be combined as a comma separated list.

## `-Dcoldfusion.disablejsafe`

Set this to `true` if you want to disable the RSA BSafe CryptoJ JCE (enterprise edition only), and use the default Oracle JCE (or another provider). 

## `-Dcoldfusion.jsafe.defaultalgo`

The setting controls the default algorithm for random number generation in CF8+ Enterprise. It is set to `FIPS186Random`

## `-Dcoldfusion.enablefipscrypto`

Set this to `true` to disable algorithms that are not FIPS approved, such as DESX, RC5, and MD5PRNG.

## `-Dcoldfusion.sessioncookie.httponly`

Applies to CF9.0.1 only. When this setting is set to true your CFID and CFTOKEN cookies will have the `httponly` flag set. Does not apply to `JSESSIONID` cookies.

For CF10+ Use `this.sessioncookie.httponly` setting in Application.cfc or ColdFusion Administrator.

## `-Dcoldfusion.session.protectfixation`

ColdFusion security hotfix APSB11-04 added protection from session fixation. When you set this setting to `false` it disables the session fixation protection. Please [read about session fixation](https://www.petefreitag.com/item/815.cfm) before changing this setting. 

## `-Dcoldfusion.fckupload`

ColdFusion 8 security hotfix hf801-77218 added this setting to block any request to `/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/` unless
this setting is set to `true`. [Read more](https://www.petefreitag.com/item/718.cfm).
