# metaphone

Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, an algorithm published in 1990 for indexing words by their English pronunciation. The algorithm produces variable length keys as its output, as opposed to Soundex's fixed-length keys. Similar sounding words share the same keys.

```javascript
metaphone(str)
```

```javascript
returns string
```
